# Long names

Every word must be written fully, so everyone understands what they mean.

In the old days we had character limitations for rows so software developers came up short names for long names. Since we have modern development environments and game engines in our toolbelt, we don't need to shorten names anymore.

## Use case

To find for example an asset, a developer can type in what they want to find, and they can find it without trying other combinations of abbreviations.

## Examples

### ✔️ Good

- ✔️ MyBackground
- ✔️ SomeFileSystem

### ❌ Bad

- ❌ MyBG
- ❌ SomeFS
